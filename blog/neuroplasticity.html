  <h1>Biohacking your brain with neuroplasticity </h1>

Most of us have heard the theory that your brain stops developing at age 25,
and that it becomes difficult to absorb new information, learn & change your brain after it has matured.
<br> There is a culturally fixed belief that our brains are biologically "set in stone" or hard wired 
as soon as we reach adulthood. <p>
Thankfully (especially for those of us new to programming language!) neuroscientific research confirms 
that genes and age are not the only factor that determines our brain development. <br>
Conditions in our environment play a crucial role in brain cell survival and formation
of connections. <br>
Neuroplasticity is the ability of neural networks in the brain to build new 
connections and reorganise pathways between neurons as a result of changes in the environment
and new experiences.  <p>
The brain has the ability to dynamically reorganise itself and adjust as a result of 
experience, environment, social interactions, and challenging experiences. <br>
Because of this, patients with cognitive impairments can recover brain functions damaged
by injury or disease. It is also a really important factor in learning, and how our
brain adapts to new information.
<p>

<p>
<h1> How neutroplasticity works: </h1>
At birth every neuron has an estimated 2,500 synapses. By age 3 this number grows to 15,000! <br>
However the average adult only has about half this number of synapses. This is because of a process
called "synaptic pruning".  <p>
  Synaptic pruining is the process of neural pathways being strengthened and others being weakened.
Neurons that are used frequently have stronger and bigger connections. Those that aren't used often
or at all eventually die. <p>

  New connections can form at an amazing speed, and you can tap into this
  through actions like placing yourself into challenging intellectual environments,
  interacting in new social situations, or getting involved in physical
  activity can all boost the growth of connections overall. 
  However these are in relationship to overall stimulation and may not be helpful in 
  rebuilding specific areas of the brain that are damaged.
<p>
  <p>
<h1> Growth Mindset </h1>
The perfect pairing with neuroplasticity for learning, is having a growth mindset.<br>
A mindset is your approach and thinking, and overall atitude. This determines our
interpretations of situations. <br>
An example of a fixed vs growth mindset: if you are approaching an intimidating subject matter (like
learning programming language) here is how two different mindsets would play out: <p>
<strong>Fixed Mindset thinking: </strong> <br>
"I'm not smart enough, my brain isn't wired for this type of learning" <br>
<strong> Outcome:</strong><br> you feel defeated, deflated, accept that you are incapable
or determine your inability to approach something down to something unchangeable(such
as genetic predisposition/ lack of technical brain) and give up
<p>
<strong>Growth Mindset thinking: </strong> <br> 
"This is a challenge for me to grow my knowledge and push the boundaries of
what I know, I will push through and embrace the struggle as an opportunity"<br>
<strong>Outcome:</strong>
<br>
You overcome the mental battle of trying to approach new information and overall feel a
sense of accomplishment
<p> 
  <p>
When people have a growth mindset, they are more likely to
believe they can achieve, become stronger, resilient and are more likely to challenge 
themselves. It can be difficult to notice and alter our engrained habits and behaviours,
but with practise and persistence we can overcome mental hurdles and achieve what we set
our sights on by reflecting and adjusting towards a direction of growth.
<p>
  <p>

  <p>
<h1>Ways to nurture a growth mindset<br>
- Acknowledge and embrace imperfections<br>
- Try to visualise completing a task and imagine feeling capable<br>
- See challenges and hardship as opportunities for growth & change<br>
- Value the process over the end result<br></h1>
<br><br> 
The way we view things can have a large impact on how we face 
challenges. Notice when something difficult happens in your life, it can be
actually be a very important opportunity for growth and reflection. Try to implement both 
neuroplasticity & a growth mindset when you face a challenge!
