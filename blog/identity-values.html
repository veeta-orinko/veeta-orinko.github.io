        <strong>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</strong>
        <p> 
        A really difficult moment where I felt my ethics and values were challenged was in a recent job opportunity (this will also go to answer the question where we are asked to describe a situation where there has been resistance and tension in a working environment)
         <p>
        Initially this job offer seemed like a really amazing opportunity, but I began to notice there were serious issues around ethical pay practises. <p> 

        <p>one of my concerns were that employees were often paid below half minimum wage and what was stated in their contract, which was really exploitative and distressing for the staff affected. It caused their lives a magnitude of instability, and there was a lot of dishonesty and lack of clarity around what each paycheque would be.
        <p>I felt like I was compromising my morals by sitting back, but had no idea how to go about expressing my concerns to my boss.
    
        
          <p>
        I knew having a conversation about this could at the very best lead to a legal pay rate for staff, and at worst with me either walking away or having my employment terminated. 
        <p>
        It was probably one of the most difficult employment related positions I’ve been in, and I don’t know if you can be prepared to have a conversation like that with someone. 
        <p> Without divulging all the details, addressing the issue with my boss was met with a lot of tension, which ultimately resulted in my being fired. <p>
        In the end I brought the issue to the employment commission. 
        <p>
      I am really glad I attempted to resolve the issue directly - it gave my boss an opportunity to be alerted to how it was making the employees feel and the position they were in. 
       There are so many lessons in this, a lot that aren't fully realised yet, but this is an example of my values being tested, how I chose to respond, and the consequences that followed.
        
        <p>

      <strong>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</strong>
        
        I was brought up in a Ukrainian family, I struggle with reflecting on my cultural identity a lot at the moment.
      <p>
        I will definitely try to think about this some more and fill this in later
        <p>
