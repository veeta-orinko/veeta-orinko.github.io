        <strong>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</strong>
        <p> 
        A really difficult moment where I felt my ethics and values were challenged was in a recent job opportunity (this will also go to answer the question where we are asked to describe a situation where there has been resistance and tension in a working environment)
         <p>
        Initially this job offer seemed like a really amazing opportunity, but I began to notice there were serious issues around ethical pay practises. <p> 

        <p>one of my concerns were that employees were often paid below half minimum wage and what was stated in their contract, which was really exploitative and distressing for the staff affected. It caused their lives a magnitude of instability, and there was a lot of dishonesty and lack of clarity around what each paycheque would be.
        <p>I felt like I was compromising my morals by sitting back, but had no idea how to go about expressing my concerns to my boss.
    
        
          <p>
        I knew having a conversation about this could at the very best lead to a legal pay rate for staff, and at worst with me either walking away or having my employment terminated. 
        <p>
        It was probably one of the most difficult employment related positions I’ve been in, and I don’t know if you can be prepared to have a conversation like that with someone. So many things come into play
        when it comes to someones financial position. Without divulging all the details, addressing the issue with my boss was met with a lot of tension, which ultimately resulted in  my being fired. 
        In the end I brought the issue to the employment commission. I am really glad I spoke up and attempted to resolve the issue directly - it gave my boss an opportunity to be alerted to how it was making the employees feel and the position they were in. 
       There are so many lessons in this, a lot that aren't fully realised yet. This is an example of my values being tested, how I chose to respond, and the consequences that followed.
        
        <p>
          <p>
        
      <strong>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</strong>
        
        I was brought up in a Ukrainian family, I struggle with reflecting on my cultural identity a lot at the moment.
      <p>
        I will definitely try to think about this some more and fill this in later
        <p>
          <p>
            <strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway? </strong>
            <p>
            
            I’m not sure exactly which direction I’d like to branch off in. I think once I get more involved in applying code, I’ll know what I love to create and what industry I’d like to use those skills in. I’ll add more here when things come to mind
            <p>
           <strong> What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy</strong>
           <p>
           I’d like to work on my skills around self confidence/ anxiety. I think working on this would have effects on my social skills on a lot of levels.
            <p>
            <strong> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives </strong>
              <p>
                I will manage my productivity primarily through effective scheduling, self reflection, and adjusting any learning habits that are causing me to digress. <p> In terms of safety I am always committed to conducting myself respectfully and considerately with my peers, and will keep myself open to any feedback.
            <p>
              
              <strong> What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you? </strong>
<p>
Try to block out some time for self care. For me this looks like exercising, spending time in nature, talking to a friend or swimming in the lake.
<p> <strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</strong>
  <p>I will reach out through the tech channel if I’m having complications with a technical issue, and reach out privately if I’m struggling a lot with the course material.
    <p><strong> A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team </strong></p> 
    I'd love to hear feedback on my work as I go, things I can improve or tweak and things I have done well.
    
    <p>
    <strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in. </strong> <p>
My current availability is: <p>
6am-7am <p>
  7am-9am preschool prep & drop off)
9am- 5pm, and 7pm-8:30pm. I am designating these hours in my day routinely for study! We live rurally so dropping my boy off to preschool is a 30 min drive each way, hence a portion of the morning being missing. I would like to keep dinnertime and my weekends to be with my wee boy and partner.  This may not be realistic in the higher intensity workloads, but I’m hopeful I can complete tasks within expected timeframes and keep my routine going!
<p>
<strong> Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</strong>
<p>My key strengths in learning is my perseverance and determination. While these are great strengths, they can also become limitations where I have a tendency to fixate and get tunnel vision on specific tasks, which can override my productivity. It’s definitely something I’m trying to be proactive in recognising, stepping back from and adjusting.
