        <h1> Foundations Reflections </h1>
        
        
        <h2> What are three new things you have learnt about yourself due to the core learning? </h2>
<p>
        I found that I had a lot of mental blocks around learning, and especially around problem solving. The core helped me add a bit of a monologue to the usually unverbalised thoughts, and seeing them written down was pretty confronting. 
<p>
        For learning, something that really resonated me in the early weeks was my partner describing my method as "having your face up against the whiteboard while trying to read what's on it". 
<p>
        In the first few weeks of this course I was pushing myself to the point of exhaustion, not stepping back and taking breaks. I think this stemmed from a fear of failure, and in the end was counter-productive as I became pretty burnt out and could barely focus on the new material coming in. I reverted to being disappointed in myself rather than celebrating how far I'd come. 
<br>
        In adjusting my approach, I've learnt to be patient with myself, celebrate and reward myself when I learn something. 
<p>
        Overall the core work has helped me reflect on my learning style, even though it was hard at times, is wrapped up in my ego where I'm afraid of failing, but that can become a catalyst for sabotage in itself.
        Positive reinforcement is key (breaks & celebration) rather than disappointment and pushing yourself even more when you don't quite get it.
<p>
<h2> What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming? </h2>
<br>
      programming is HARD, and something difficult requires a specific mindset in order to break through such a steep learning curve and walls that you hit along the way. You have to be self aware enough to change and adjust specific mentalities in order to keep growing and learning, and push through the barriers that tell you you're too dumb/ not technical minded enough, etc.
<br>
      Self awareness keeps you in check, empathy is important for working with other people, and values are that foundational base that helps you navigate the tough spots or things you're struggling with. Values are good to reflect on when you feel a bit lost and need a bit of a revival.
<p>


<h2>  What has surprised you the most about the core learning? </h2>
<p>
      learning programming at such a fast pace can be a really emotional process, and 
      I've been surprised at how core reflecting has helped me break through a lot of learning barriers 

<p>


<h2> What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning? </h2> 
<p>
      I think being open online about my emotions after conciously trying to have a really small digital footprint was the hardest bit for me. 
<br>  I value my privacy, often feel quite shy, so I struggled with the aspect of
      having my actual name tied to a website as well as sharing my personal thoughts here.
<br>
      Breaking through that wall was okay in the end - caring or worrying about that stuff when life is so interwoven into the online sphere just causes so much agony in the long run. Though it felt really emotional at first, overcoming that came pretty quickly. I'm learning that once you break through these walls only good things follow. 
<p>

<h2> 
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course? 
</h2>
<p>

      Coming from a background with no experience in programming, learning about this stuff at such a fast pace can be pretty emotional. <br> I think the core reflections help with gaining awareness around those harder moments, and suggests implementing rituals and routines that keep you zen and sane. 
<p>
      At the very least, in my breaking points where I hadn't fully adopted the core learns yet, core learning definitely planted seeds which eventually grew into actual healthy habits around my learning. <br>
      I'm actually kind of amazed at how much core work has done for me already.
 
<p>
<h2> 
      Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
</h2> 

  <p>
      No, it doesn't feel like a waste of time. I'll admit that it could have actually been a breaking point for me in the course as I felt heaps of resistance towards it initially, but I totally get it now.
