    <h2 class="niceblue center"> The Difference Between ID's and Classes </h2>
</div>

  <p class="text2"> For our assigned blog project, we've been set with the task of explaining the difference between classes and ID's. 
    
To a new learner of HTML classes and ID's can initially seem very similar, However, there are some key differences between the two. <br>
   <br>
I will begin with the similarities: Both ID and class are attributes used in HTML and CSS.   <br>
   In CSS a ".class" always begins with a period, and an "#id" always begins with a hashtag. 
  
  <br>
The key difference between the two, is that ID, in best practise, is primarily used to target one element,
whereas a class is usually used to target a group of elements.
 
   <br>
   <br>

   <strong>an example of the use of an ID in CSS would look like this: <br>
   <br>

   </strong>
  <img src= "../images/idclass1.png" width = 400>
    
<br>
<br><strong>
Then this would be referenced through HTML: 
</strong>
<br>
<br>

<img src=" ../images/idclass2.png" width = 400>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>
Here, the outcome is a bold green heading:
</strong>

<h2 class=center id="heading"> 

  hello world </h2>

  <p class="text2">

Now to reiterate: An ID attribute would <strong>only be applied to a specific segment of code</strong> <br>
 (such as a heading) whereas a class would usually be
<strong>assigned to a group. </strong> <br>
For example in CSS:
<br>
<br>


<img src="../images/article1.png" width="400">
<br>
<br>



<strong>In this example, class is being assigned to a type of text that is likely to be present in multiple
parts of a webpage: an article, whereas an ID was used in a specific element - the heading. </strong>

<br>
<br>
  <br>
<img src="../images/classarticle.png"width="800">

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<strong>The outcome is BEAUTIFUL pink text: </strong>

<img src="../images/finaltext.png">


<br>
<br>

so, hopefully now the case between differentiating when to assign classes and ID's are fully clear to you now.
Go off and assign id's and class with your powerful new knowledge!
