        <h1> Problem Solving </h1>

<h2> Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you were blocked on a simple problem:</h2>
        

          I felt incredibly blocked with the Kata built in methods segment. Built in methods are actions we can perform
          within JavaScript. We call or use these methods by appending an instance with a period, the name of the method,
          and an opening and closing parentheses - e.g. 'example string'.toUpperCase() would print "EXAMPLE STRING".
      <p>

           Methods are a relatively new concept for me, and I was really struggling to understand the proper syntax of 
           implementing the methods. I tried to extend the time I spent focusing on this challenge, and really give
           myself the opportunity to try give it my best shot. I followed all the recommendations in the "hint" section,
           but overall still wasn't really grasping it after two days of focus, revision, and reading.
      
      <p>
           I felt quite frustrated as I was reading so much information, but wasn't retaining any of it or
           quite grasping how to implement it. I'm definitely experiencing a huge mental block around this subject.
           Normally at this stage I would begin putting a lot of pressure on myself, and would start to get 
           quite overwhelmed. With the reflections we've been doing about our learning style I've begun to recognise
           patterns in learning that are obstructive, so I decided to step back and reassess my
           approach when I noticed that I was getting frustrated. 
      <p>
           I decided to reach out to my course facilitator, Gerard, and let him know where I was at with this segment.
           We came to a solution to set up a group study session, and for me to work on revision.
      <p>
           This isn't an elegant solution, but it is definitely elegant compared to my approach a few weeks ago! 
           I'm noticing an improvement in my self awareness around learning & mental blocks.
      <br> I have learnt it's important to step back, take a breather and reasess your angle. 
      <br> Getting everything right isn't the most important thing, it's about trying to find new solutions 
           and approaches to taking in the material, and reaching out before you get too overwhelmed.

      <p>
<h2> Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h2>
      <p>
              I will be using a star rating system for this 
      <br>
              5 stars = extremely confident 
      <br>    4 stars = pretty confident
      <br>    3 stars = confident-ish 
      <br>    2 stars = not very confident
      <br>    1 star = antithesis of confidence
