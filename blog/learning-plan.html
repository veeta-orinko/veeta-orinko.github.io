    <h1>My learning plan</h1>


<strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway? </strong>
<p>

I’m not sure exactly which direction I’d like to branch off in. I think once I get more involved in applying code, I’ll know what I love to create and what industry I’d like to use those skills in. I’ll add more here when things come to mind
<p>
<strong> What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy</strong>
<p>
I’d like to work on my skills around self confidence/ anxiety. I think working on this would have effects on my social skills on a lot of levels.
<p>
<strong> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives </strong>
  <p>
    I will manage my productivity primarily through effective scheduling, self reflection, and adjusting any learning habits that are causing me to digress. <p> In terms of safety I am always committed to conducting myself respectfully and considerately with my peers, and will keep myself open to any feedback.
<p>
  
  <strong> What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you? </strong>
<p>
Try to block out some time for self care. For me this looks like exercising, spending time in nature, talking to a friend or swimming in the lake.
<p> <strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</strong>
<p>I will reach out through the tech channel if I’m having complications with a technical issue, and reach out privately if I’m struggling a lot with the course material.
<p><strong> A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team </strong></p> 
I'd love to hear feedback on my work as I go, things I can improve or tweak and things I have done well.

<p>
<strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in. </strong> <p>
An outline of my schedule:
<p><p> Mon-Fri<p>
6am-7am: studying <p>
block-out: 7am-9am (preschool prep & drop off) <p>
9am- 5pm: studying
<p>
 block-out: 5pm-7pm
  <p>
7pm-8:30pm: studying

<p> I would like to keep dinnertime and my weekends to be with my wee boy and partner.  This may not be realistic in the higher intensity workloads, but I’m hopeful I can complete tasks within expected timeframes and keep my routine going!
<p>
<strong> Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</strong>
<p>My key strengths in learning is my perseverance and determination. While these are great strengths, they can also become limitations where I have a tendency to fixate and get tunnel vision on specific tasks, which can override my productivity. It’s definitely something I’m trying to be proactive in recognising, stepping back from and adjusting.
