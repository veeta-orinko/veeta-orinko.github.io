<strong>
         What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
</strong> 
<p>       
          I expect to put all of my energy and time into bootcamp, and to fully 
          dedicate myself for the next 2 months. This means showing up to every class
          and completeing evey project. I want to step back before I hit burn out, 
          and to check in with myself, and regularly take short breaks.
<p>
<strong>
          What is your long term goal or career pathway? 

</strong>
<p>

        I’m not sure exactly which direction I’d like to branch off in. I’m dabbling in all
        sorts of ideas, I love the idea of making applications to organise data and information,
        I could do this to help businesses operate more smoothly. There's also a part of me 
        that would really love to branch off into cyber security/ info security. 
        This is all up in the air, and I'm still floating about my direction but I'm really
        excited about all the opportunities ahead of me.
  <p>
<strong> 
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
      
</strong>


   <p>
        I'll definitely struggle with speaking in front of a group. 
        Public speaking is one of my biggest fears, and I'd really love to get over this.
        I'm so confident in other ways that this fear doesn't seem to make sense, so it might
        just be a matter of desensitising myself with exposure.

 <br>   I may also struggle with being burnt out and overworking, I've recognised in 
        foundations that I burnt out because I didn't take enough breaks or rest. 
        That caused me to hit a major wall in week 5 where I couldn't 
        focus for days. I recognise that overworking short term might get things done,
        but in the long run, it's really counter-productive and can set me back a week.
        


<strong> 
          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like 
          to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy
</strong>
<p>

        I'd like to work on leadership skills, as I really enjoy 
        organising and guiding people, I think the skills in this area to work on would be 
        empathy + sensitivity to peoples needs, perceptiveness to their particular
         skillsets and strengths and an ability to guide them into the right direction 
         in a way that isn't micro-managey, but not so laid back that people feel confused or
         aimless. I think good leadership can help bring out the best in people and make them
         feel valued in a team.
<p>
<strong> 
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
          This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work 
          productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community 
          representatives 
</strong>
  <p>
          I will manage my productivity primarily through effective scheduling, 
          self reflection, and adjusting any learning habits that are causing me any setbacks. 
    <p>   In terms of safety I am always committed to conducting myself respectfully and 
          considerately with my peers, and will keep myself open to any feedback.
    <p>
        


    <strong>  
          What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?  
    </strong>
    <p>
          Try to block out some time for self care. For me this looks like exercising, 
          spending time in nature, talking to a friend or swimming in the lake.

    <p> 
    <strong>    

          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
    </strong>
    <p> 
          I will reach out through the tech channel if I’m having complications with 
          a technical issue, and reach out privately if I’m struggling a lot with 
          the course material.
    <p>
    <strong> 
      What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
    </strong>
    </p> 
          I don't need much interaction or guidance, but hearing feedback is something
          that I really need/ want from the bootcamp team and facilitators. 
          This is probably the best way to support me as a student.
          Communication on where needs improvement as well as what I've done really well will 
          help motivate me and give me a clear idea of what needs work. 
          As I'm not skilled in this field, it's really hard to gage that stuff on my own.
    <br>
      
        

    <p>
    <strong>
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other 
          things </strong> <p>
    <p> 
          I have cleared my schedule to be free between 7:30am - 5.30pm
          I would ideally love to keep weekends and evenings to be family time,
          and to rest as I think rest is crucial to a more productive day following.
          <p>
    <strong>  

          What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
    </strong>
    <p>
          My key strengths will be my perseverance and determination. 
          While these are great strengths, they can also become limitations - I get
          tunnel vision, and have a tendency to overwork myself to the point where I crash. 
          I am being proactive about fixing this, and so far have managed to find ways to 
          step back from that tunnel vision and adjust my angle, but will need to work on not
          overworking.
