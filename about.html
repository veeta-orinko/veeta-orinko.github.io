    <h1>Hi, I'm Veeta.</h1>
    <h2> <p> I'm a web development student based in Makarora, New Zealand. </p>
      <p>I mainly work with photoshop, HTML & CSS. More tools will be added to this list in the next few months (if I come out of the bootcamp alive)

      I think the web should be organic, weird, interesting and accessible. </p>
