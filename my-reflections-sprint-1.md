# My Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer 

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?
The command line is a text to prompt interface that speaks directly to a computers operating system

I struggle to draw comparison with an analogy that is more analogue based, but maybe something like our minds could be a good comparison to the command line.
Imagine that your brain is an operating system, and the command line interface is your conciousness. Text to prompt are what mobilises your thoughts (text) to action (prompt) in the interface.


### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?

I did not stick with the timebox guidelines but I'm happy with that. I spent a lot longer on the project because I've never worked with command line so it was important to spend a long time processing, retaining, and revising.

### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.

1. cd = change directory 
2. ls = lists the files
3. Command+K = clears the terminal
4. Open . = opens a directory file currently in the terminal
5. Open . -a Safari = opens file in safari (or other programme you type in its place)


### Did you learn anything unexpected?
The terminal is a lot less intimidating than I had imagined, one wrong line of code in the terminal does not make your computer explode (like I had thought as a child)


# Version Control with Git 

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What's the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is a sofware tool & github is a service.
Git is version control software that allows developers to collaborate without writing over eachothers changes.
Git Hub provides file hosting, primarily it is used by developers to share open source projects and connect with eachother


### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
I'm going to draw a really bad comparison between git & github with a Liliput Library.
Liliputs are communal libraries, which are scattered accross the country in lots of different local communities and each and every single one of them are filled with (terrible) books.
Like liliput holds books, github holds project files which can be accessed by the online community. 
Usually someone manages the liliput and removes books, which could be seen as similar to staging and committing adjustments to code.
Git is like the wooden liliput frame/ shelf which holds all the books. It mobilises the function of collaboration by being the container for it....


### Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?
Yes


### Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
Yes! 


# Install and Explore Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is a Git workflow?
A git workflow is a way for developers to use Git effectively. There are many different workflow recipes, but essentially they are systems to optimise usage of git


### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?

I noticed early in the day I experienced fatigue and mental blocks, there was at least 2-3 hours where I struggled to engage or read any of the material. I tried changing study environment/ leaving the house with no luck. Eventually I was able to re-engage by writing some of the material down.

I think that my brain is adapting. Retaining a large amount of information will take some adjusting to, I just have to persist with pushing down those mental blocks and find strategies to refresh myself somehow

### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?
I would have gone for a run or swim to re-invigorate myself once I hit the walls. In future, as a rule, I will go outside and move around a bit more whenever I encounter a block.


# Track and Commit

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?
I would describe "stage" as a process where you are preparing something to be finalised, like a final draft of a essay or story. I would describe "commit" as being where you are submitting your final draft and physically handing it over to be reviewed or marked (before revising and altering again)


# Branch, Pull, Merge

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is main?
Usually repositories have a main branch. A main describes a main branch and is where the best and well tested code lives


### Why create a Branch?
a branch is a way to split off and take a copy of code from the main, without disrupting or making changes to the main. this way you can experiment and test things out before either merging into the main or making a pull request


### Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?  
initially difficult, but the more I re-read or revise and practise, the easier the information becomes to understand. I feel like I have a sound level of understanding now.


# GitHub Fork & Clone

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

### What are some examples of when you would fork?
You might want to fork when you're working on a piece of code in a team. Forking means you can work independently on the same code without altering the main branch but can later submit your changes to be reviewed by another member in the team by staging and committing

### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?
Not that I can recall. For me the understanding is gradual rather than a click.


# Setup Repo & Create Blog


### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?
This was a good activity, not all the answers provided and I needed to solve a few problems.
I felt a bit confused when it didn't work. Initially my .html file wasn't pushing and I couldn't work out why. It turns out I needed to do <git add index.html > before committing it. and then I struggled to push it, because I was pushing from the index.html directory rather than the main directory!


### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?

Definitely had no idea! It's far from what I pictured, my preconception was that you would build or begin a website within the browser.


# Thinking like a programmer

### What is your process so far for solving problems?





# Introduce yourself

### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? 



### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious?
